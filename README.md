Task Plan: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QsNrgIGv8CESoXGcuVemh7mpvuvKN3iwLNKmA_gX_p4/edit)

##Tasks:
- Plot events from dataset on a map with different types of damage
- Plot events over time as a stacked graph
- Categorize by areas and types of damage
- We can show calculated total damage when categorizing by area
- Plot approximation lines
- Plot areas of deviation
- Plot events over animated time with a parallel coordinate graph
- Show all types of damage individually
- We can show approximation and deviation within a certain timestep
##Data:
- Time filtering
- Filter the data by time range
- We can use a brush or double slider
- Average values by entries in a given time-step within the range
- We can use a drop-down or a log-scale slider
